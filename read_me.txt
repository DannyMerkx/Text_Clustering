For testing the aco implementation you can just call the main function. It should work properly if all
these files are kept in one folder. Do note that the main function uses the matlab parallel processing
toolbox. Simply chance the parfor loop into a for loop if you have no acces to this toolbox.
Be aware that the algorithm might take a long time to run if you do this

Only bbc.mtx is needed if you want to test on the bbc database, however I have included all the
files downloaded from http://mlg.ucd.ie/datasets/bbc.html just in case. 

The code should be clearly documented but you can mail to dannymerkx@student.ru.nl with questions.
